# Health and Human Services Presentation in final folder (only powerpoint file in folder)

Over the period 2012-2019, HHS has outsourced $165B of products and services
HHS outsourcing has grown by 20% over 8 years, thereâ€™s no discernible difference in the trend between administrations
While contracts have been awarded to 45 foreign countries, more than 99% of contract dollars are attributable to US companies
Low competition can lead to the government paying higher prices for goods and services. Despite most HHS contracts being open for competition, the data shows that there are very few companies that are fighting for each contract.
